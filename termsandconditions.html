                            You have the right to cancel this contract within 14 days without giving any reason.
                            The cancellation period will expire after 14 days from the day.
                            To exercise the right to cancel, you must inform us [See Note 2] of your decision to cancel
                            this contract by a clear statement (e.g. a letter sent by post, fax, or e-mail). You may use the
                            attached model cancellation form, but it is not obligatory. [See Note 3]
                            To meet the cancellation deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication
                            concerning your exercise of the right to cancel before the cancellation period has expired.

                            We may make a deduction from the reimbursement for loss in value of any goods supplied
                            if the loss is the result of unnecessary handling by you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We will make the reimbursement without undue delay, and not later than:

                                    if there were no goods supplied, 14 days after the day on which we are informed about
                                    your decision to cancel this contract.
                                </li>
